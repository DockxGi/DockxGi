I'm Gino, Java Developer and Web Developer.
Currently not having a lot of time to collaborate.
So I'm focussing on little projects.

Currently I'm a lot focussed on code quality.
Interested in how to write code better, improve maintainability,
avoiding complex architecture.

I'm not interested in showing off my skills in a way that nobody understand so
that people think that I'm some kind of genius. Instead I try to explain
complex functionality by breaking it up in simple parts that everybody can
understand.
